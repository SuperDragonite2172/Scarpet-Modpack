# Scarpet Modpack
A Minecraft "modpack" made with Scarpet and datapacks.

### Modpack Version: 0.1
### Suggested Carpet Version: <Version Number Here>

## What is this project?
This project is an attempt to create a modpack-like experience for Minecraft but without requiring mods to be installed on every client.  Instead of using only datapacks, I'm leveraging the power of Scarpet because it offers various abilities that aren't possible with datapacks.

## What is a "Scarpet"?

Scarpet is a scripting language from the Carpet mod.  It runs inside Minecraft and allows you do many things that would normally be difficult to do with datapacks and other things not possible with datapacks.  Check out the Carpet mod [here](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet "Carpet GitHub").

## How do I install this "modpack"?

The Scarpet modpack is dependent on Carpet so make sure that is installed first.  The suggested version is listed at the top of the README.md along with a link to the release in the Carpet repository.

To install the modpack, clone the repository and paste the folders into your world file of choice.
